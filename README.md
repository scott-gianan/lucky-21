# How to Play the Game

The objective of the game is to beat the dealer with a higher valued hand as close to 21 as possible. Tens and face cards are worth 10 points, aces are worth 1 point, and 2-9 are scored at face value.

**Flow of the Game:**

1. You must first bet before playing a round.
2. The dealer will hand out two (2) cards each for you and for the dealer itself.
3. You can either `HIT` (draw another card) or `STAND` (if you're confident that your hand value is already high enough to beat the dealer's hand value).

- Note: if you decided to `HIT` and your hand value exceeds 21, then you lose the round, but if your hand value adds up to 21, then you win the round.

4. The game will keep on running until you run out of money.
